# Josephus-Problem

I just have used Bruce forced technique to solve it . In the sequential to formulate it in my way i simple seen the common sequence repeated in the problem eg 
"1 -> 1"
2 -> 1
"3 -> 3"
4 -> 1
5 -> 3
6 -> 5
"7 -> 7"
8 -> 1
9 -> 3
10 -> 5
11 -> 7
12 -> 9
13 -> 11
14 -> 13
"15 -> 15"
16 -> 1
17 -> 3

The same values on both give a prediction to stop the and calculate a simple old value upto the remaining string inputs .
